# Human Activity Recognition Project

A machine Learning model that predicts human activities such as standing, sitting, laying, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, etc from the Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings
of their smartphones.
Various Machine Learning algorithms were tested and their hyperparameters were tuned to give the best accuracy.
Best accuracy was given by Logistic Regression and RBF SVM classifier (96.27%), followed by LinearSVC (95.55%). Tree based models gave less accurate results.


STEP 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis
Prepared training and testing dataframes from features given in text files. A total of 561 features are there.
